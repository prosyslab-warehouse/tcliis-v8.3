ezMPEG is an easy-to-use and easy-to-understand MPEG1 video encoder API

The documentation of the API is still in development and incomplete. It can
be found in 'doc/ezmpeg.txt'

To use the API just include 'ezmpeg.h' in your files and compile with
gcc yourfile.c ezmpeg.c -o yourfile -lm

You are free to use any other C compiler than gcc
