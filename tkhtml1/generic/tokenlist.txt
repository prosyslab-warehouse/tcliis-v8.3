#
# This file contains raw data used to build the "htmltokens.c" file.
# Each line contains 2 or 3 elements.  The first word on each line is
# the name of some HTML markup.  The second word is the amount of
# space to allocate for the corresponding element.  "0" appears if
# no extra space (beyond HtmlMarkup) is required.  If there is a
# corresponding end-tag, then the third column specifies the size of
# the end markup.
